*1. Wash with Soap and Water 

Clean the affected area with mild soap and water to prevent infection.

*2. Ice 

Wrap an ice pack, or a bag of ice or frozen vegetables in a cloth. Place the bundle against the site of the sting. Hold the bundle in place for several minutes. 

*3. Aloe Vera Gel

Aloe vera is a plant-based gel that naturally soothes and moisturizes the skin. According to studies, aloe vera extract has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.

Spreading a little gel onto the bee sting can reduce swelling and help prevent the site from becoming infected.

*4. Calamine Lotion

Apply a considerable amount of Calamine Lotion over the affected area. It will help reduce pain and itching caused by a sting from a bee or wasp.

*5. Honey

Honey has many medicinal properties. It contains compounds that combat inflammation, so it may help reduce swelling.

Try spreading a small amount of honey onto the sting. Do this indoors, so the smell of the honey does not attract more bees.
